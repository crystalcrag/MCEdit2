<h1>MCEdit internals</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>Some of the algorithms and data structures used in MCEdit 2.0 are not that trivial to understand by looking at the source
code, even heavily commented, especially since the rendering engine makes heavy use of what appears to be cryptic static tables.
This document will provide in-depth explanation for some of them.

<p><b>Pre-requisite</b>: knowledge of OpenGL, 3D math and C programming language.

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>Before reading this document further, there are a few facts to keep in mind, because they are used
quite extensively throughout the engine. To avoid repeating them over and over again, here is what needs
to be known:

<h3 id="coord"><span>Coordinate system</span></h3>

<div class="photo" style="float:left">
  <img src="images/axis.svg">
</div>

<p>The <b>coordinate system uses a left hand axis</b>. X is mapped to east-west (increasing X goes to east,
decreasing goes to west). Z is mapped to north-south (increasing Z goes to south, decreasing goes to
north). Y is elevation.

<p>Meshes of various objects use a counter-clockwise (CCW) orientation to check if they are front-facing.

<p>Coordinates are relative to player (ie: if you want an object close to camera, coordinates must
be close to player position, not 0,0,0). <span class="n">XXX</span> That's not good actually: coords
are stored in floats, loss of precision will be problematic.

<h3 id="rotation"><span>Angles</span></h3>

<p>Angles in this engine tried to be mapped on the trigonometric circle (especially rotation on Y axis).
That way, the output of cosine and sine functions can be used directly without unnecessary conversion.
Here are how they are mapped to each axis, keep that in mind, it is <b>very easy to mix them up</b>:

<div class="photo" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 40px">
  <img src="images/rotateY.png">
  <cap>Rotation on Y axis (left-hand axis)</cap>
</div><div class="photo" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 40px">
  <img src="images/rotateX.png">
  <cap>Rotation on X axis</cap>
</div>

<p>With entites, there are some exceptions though: orientation will depend on how the model is created.
To avoid some headache, it is strongly advised to keep the orientation above: if the entity rotation is 0,
it should be facing east.

<h3 id="faceorder"><span>Face enumeration order</span></h3>

<p>Whenever there is a need to enumerate nearby objects within the voxel space, the <b>same order will
be used almost everytime</b>. For example: to enumerate the 6 nearby voxels a given block is directly
connected to, to enumerate the 6 neighbors a given chunk is connected to, to generate the mesh of the
6 faces a given cube is composed of, ... these will always be done in the same order:
<ol>
  <li><b>South</b>
  <li><b>East</b>
  <li><b>North</b>
  <li><b>West</b>
  <li><b>Top</b>
  <li><b>Bottom</b>
</ol>

<p>Keep that order in mind, it is <b><u>used extensively</u></b> in one form or another throughout the entire code
base. It can be used as indices in a for-loop from 0 to 5, be used as a bit field to remember which
sides have been visited (therefore have values from 0 to 63), or simply as a enumeration value
(<tt>SIDE_*</tt>).

<p>You'll often see the abbreviation <tt>S,E,N,W,T,B</tt> (or sometimes just <tt>S,E,N,W</tt>) throughout
the code base, this is a reminder of this order.

<p>Technically, there are no obligations to respect that order all over the place, but it makes it easy
to reuse the same look-up tables over and over again, without having to worry about compatibility.

<h3 id="datatypes"><span>Datatypes</span></h3>

<p>Datatypes in the engine follows a small, but kind of helpful convention: if a structure has to be
declared as a value, <b>it is not</b> typedef'ed, and the name <b>always have</b> a trailing <tt>_t</tt>
(the t stands for <tt>type</tt> of course).

<p>If there are no trailing <tt>_t</tt> and no <tt class="t">struct</tt>, therefore it is a pointer. Consider the
following example:
<pre><t>struct</t> BlockIter_t iter;
BlockIter iterator;</pre>

<p>From this convention, you know the second declaration is a pointer to a <tt><t>struct</t> BlockIter_t</tt>.

<p>Sometimes a typedef is introduced for <tt class="t">struct</tt> to remove the need to type this keyword,
because the type itself is used quite extensively. For example:
<pre><t>typedef struct</t> NBTIter_t     NBTIter_t;
<t>typedef struct</t> NBTFile_t     NBTFile_t;</pre>
<p>But, the type will keep the <tt>_t</tt> suffix to indicate it is a value type, not a pointer.
