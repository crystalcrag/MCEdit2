<h1 style="counter-set: h2 1">2. Frustum culling</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>Frustum culling refer to the algorithm that can enumerate all the objects that are visible within
the model-view-projection matrix. It is usually a compromise between precision of object's bounding
box and computational power required to test those bounding boxes: we cannot spent too much time on
the CPU checking for object's visibility (because in the meantime the graphics card could have probably
already rendered this object) and on the other hand, including out-of-view objects, will requires useless
work for both the CPU and the GPU.

<p><b>Pre-requisite</b>: basic 3D math.
</div>

<h2 id="culling">Frustum culling: overview</h2>

<p>The techniques used in this engine are not particularly revolutionary, but there are <b>a lot of edge
cases</b> to take care, that makes the overall algorithm not so trivial and quite extensive.

<p>A <prod>Minecraft</prod> terrain is composed of a grid of chunks: axis-aligned boxes of 16x16x16 voxels.
A typical terrain with a render distance of 16 chunks, contains about 4,000 of these sub-chunks. A frustum
with a field of view of 80&deg; will cross about 1,000 of them: that's a decent amount of information
culled and therefore worth doing.

<p>Since chunks are aligned in a grid, it means they share a lot of vertices: if we know that one corner
of a chunk fits within the frustum, we can automatically add the 7 others chunks that share this vertex.

<p>In other words by testing only one vertex, we can potentially add up to 8 chunks to the list of visible
objects. Which means  on average, we will have to <b>test one point per chunk</b>. <em>That is reasonably 
cheap</em>.

<p>Testing if a vertex is part of a frustum is actually very easy: we can use the MVP matrix (the exact
same one that will be used in the vertex shader), by simply multiplying that matrix with the coordinates
of our vertex (using 1 as the fourth vector component). That is:
<pre>V<sub>p</sub> = MVP * V</pre>
<p>Then to test if a vertex is inside the frustum, we can simply use the properties of homogeneous coordinates:
<pre>Vp is in frustum if:
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>px</sub> and V<sub>px</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub> and
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>py</sub> and V<sub>py</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub> and 
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pz</sub> and V<sub>pz</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub>
</pre>

<p><tt>V<sub>pw</sub></tt> is the fourth component of our projected point. More precisely, each of
these inequalities check if the coordinate is outside one of the 6 planes that defines the frustum.
We'll need that information later.

<p>In this engine, a <tt>struct Chunk_t</tt> (or <tt>Chunk</tt> if you just want a pointer) is a datatype
that reference an entire column of 16x16 blocks of terrain. A <tt>struct ChunkData_t</tt> (or <tt>ChunkData</tt>
as a pointer type) contain all the data (block IDs, sky light, block light, meta-data, ...) for one
16x16x16 blocks of terrain. Keep those datatypes in mind, they will be used throughout this section.

<h3 id="firstvers"><span>First version (pseudo-code)</span></h3>

<p>So, a first version for this algorithm would be:
<div class="pre">
<ul>
  <li>Start with a empty list of visible chunk.
  <li>Add the chunk where the player in that list.
  <li>For each chunk in that list:
    <ul>
	  <li>For each of the 8 corners of the chunk:
	    <ul>
		  <li>Check if corner is in frustum.
		  <li>If yes, add 8 connected chunks to the end of the list (if the chunk has not already been added yet).
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
</div>

<p>That algorithm seems pretty simple, but lacks <b>a lot</b> of house-keeping required to achieve our
goal of one vertex checked per chunk.

<p>As simple as this version is, it already has a few interesting properties:
<ul>
  <li>There was no particular constraints on the MVP matrix, and indeed this algorithm will work for <b>any projection</b> (orthogonal,
  perspective) <b>any FOV</b> and any <b>render distance</b> (near and far plane).
  <li>The list of chunks will mostly be sorted from front to back. It is not perfect, but good enough to trigger some early depth culling
  from the GPU.
</ul>

<h3 id="impl"><span>Implementation (C code)</span></h3>

<p>Sadly, the implementation is a lot more complex than this though. Most of the complexity is to deal
with edge cases though. If you look at the datatype needed for generating the visible list, you can
see there are a few static tables:
<pre style="font-size: 1vw"><t>struct</t> Frustum_t
{
   <t>int32_t</t> neighbors[<v>8</v>];       <span class="c">/* 8 corners having 8 neighbors: bitfield encode 27 neighbors */</span>
   <t>uint8_t</t> chunkOffsets[<v>27</v>];   <span class="c">/* bitfield of where each chunks are (S, E, N, W, T, B) */</span>
   <t>uint8_t</t> faces[<v>6</v>*<v>4</v>];         <span class="c">/* cross-plane faces */</span>
   <t>uint8_t</t> faceDir[<v>6</v>];         <span class="c">/* direction to go to find chunk connected to face */</span>
   <t>uint8_t</t> firstFree[<v>256</v>];     <span class="c">/* fake chunk allocator */</span>
   <t>float</t> * mvp;                <span class="c">/* model-view-projection matrix (4x4) */</span>
};
</pre>

<p>To achieve what's described in the first algorithm, we only need the first 2 tables: <tt>neighbors</tT> and <tt>chunkOffsets</tt>.

<div class="photo" id="vtxorder" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin: 0 0 0 20px">
  <img src="images/cube.svg" width="100%">
  <cap>Vertex order of a chunk</cap>
</div>

<p>The order of each corner of a chunk is illustrated with the figure on the right. Each of these
corners can potentially add 8 chunks, if that corner is contained within the frustum. By overlapping
all those connected chunks you get a 3x3 cube of chunks. Therefore, the maximum number of connected
chunks you can have from those 8 corners is 27.

<p>This is what encodes the <tt>neighbors</tt> table: each of these 27 chunks are given a number
between 0 and 26, and therefore can be encoded as a bitfield in a 32bit integer. The order is shown below
(axis is the same as the figure on the right):

<table class="skewed" id="cube3x3">
<tr><td>25<td>15<td>23
<tr><td>17<td>5<td>12
<tr><td>21<td>9<td>19
</table>

<table class="skewed">
<tr><td>14<td>3<td>11
<tr><td>4<td><v>0</v><td>2
<tr><td>8<td>1<td>7
</table>

<table class="skewed">
<tr><td>26<td>16<td>24
<tr><td>18<td>6<td>13
<tr><td>22<td>10<td>20
</table>

<p><tt>0</tt> is the chunk we are currently in. The numbers are ordered by scanning each number (starting
from 0 in the center) and looking in the <tt>S, E, N, W, T, B</tt> directions if the chunk has been
assigned to something. If not, it will be assigned to the next free number. The process continues until
all 27 slots have been set.

<p>The purpose of this order is to be able to scan surrounding chunks by their distance from the center
chunk: number 0 is the center, 1 to 6 are chunks one step away from center, 7 to 18 are two steps away
and 19 to 26 are 3 steps away (the steps being a <tt>S, E, N, W, T, B</tt> step). This order will
be required by the cave culling algorithm.

<p>For example, if we checked that vertex <tt>0</tt> of a chunk is within the frustum, we know we can
also add chunks <tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt>, <tt>6</tt>, <tt>14</tt>, <tt>16</tt>, <tt>18</tt> and <tt>26</tt>.
Chunk 0 is not included, because at this point we already know that the center chunk is part of the frustum.
Encoded as bitfield, with the n<sup>th</sup> bit set if chunk number <tt>n</tt> is in the frustum, the
7 chunks to add for vertex 0 can be encoded as <tt>2<sup>3-1</sup> + 2<sup>4-1</sup> + 2<sup>6-1</sup> +
2<sup>14-1</sup> + 2<sup>16-1</sup> + 2<sup>18-1</sup> + 2<sup>26-1</sup> = 0x0202a02c</tt>, and so on
for the other 7 corners: that's what is stored in the <tt>neighbors</tt> table.


<h3 id="neighbors"><span>Enumerating neighbors</span></h3>

<p>To enumerate all the connected chunks, we'll check if each corner of a chunk is within the frustum
and accumulate those neighbor bitfields into a 32bit integer. Then, we can just use the <tt>chunkOffsets</tt>
table to locate the n<sup>th</sup> chunk (with <tt>n</tt> varying from 0 to 26). Therefore this table
will have 27 elements. Each element is a bitfield with the following meaning:
<ul>
  <li>bit 1 set: move to the <b>south</b> (+Z).
  <li>bit 2 set: move to the <b>east</b> (+X).
  <li>bit 3 set: move to the <b>north</b> (-Z).
  <li>bit 4 set: move to the <b>west</b> (-X).
  <li>bit 5 set: move to the <b>top</b> (+Y).
  <li>bit 6 set: move to the <b>bottom</b> (+Y).
</ul>

<p>If the chunk is tagged by the bitfield, it is then added at the end of the visible list, to be
scanned later to see if we can reach new chunks from here. We continue then until the entire list
has been scanned.

<h3 id="edgecase" style="clear: both"><span>Edge cases</span></h3>

<p>This first version easily <b>covers around 90% to 99%</b> of the chunks we need to enumerate, but
it can miss some especially around the corners of frustum. This version also breaks down when the FOV
gets too small. Consider the following frustum:

<div class="image">
  <img src="images/fov10deg.png">
  <cap>Frustum with a 10&deg; FOV</cap>
</div>

<p>Technically, a frustum should be more of a trapezoidal shape, but the parameters used for the near and far plane in
<prod>MCEdit 2.0</prod> are respectively 0.1 and 1000, which gives almost a triangular shape.

<p>You can see here that none of the vertex from the corners of every chunks fit within the frustum. Yet, the frustum does indeed
cross some chunks. How do we enumerate these?

<p>For these, we can use the properties of homogeneous coordinates, when checking if a point is in the frustum: 

<pre>Vp is in frustum if:
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>px</sub> and V<sub>px</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub> and
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>py</sub> and V<sub>py</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub> and 
	-V<sub>pw</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pz</sub> and V<sub>pz</sub> &lt;= V<sub>pw</sub>
</pre>

<p>Each of these inequalities tells us on which side of each plane the point is. For example if <tt>V<sub>pz</sub> &lt; -V<sub>pw</sub></tt>
is true, that means the point is behind the near plane. Similarly, if <tt>V<sub>pz</sub> &gt; V<sub>pw</sub></tt> is true, the point is beyond the
far plane, and so on...

<h3 id="crossplane"><span>Cross-plane faces</span></h3>

<p>We can then keep track of which plane the point is outside of, using a bitfield. Since there are
6 planes, a single byte will be enough. That is the purpose of the <tt>outflags</tt> table in the
<tt><t>struct</t> Chunk_t</tt> type: keep track of which planes the origin corner
of each sub-chunk (16x16x16 area, <tt><t>struct</t> ChunkData_t</tt> in the
code) is outside of. The origin corner is the location of block 0, 0, 0 within the chunk.

<p>Therefore to get the <tt>outflags</tt> values of the 8 corners of a <tt>ChunkData</tt>, we will
have to extract them from the 4 neighbor chunks (<tt><t>struct</t> Chunk_t</tt>):
for example the <tt>outflags</tt> value for the coordinate <tt>chunk.x + 16, chunk.y, chunk.z</tt>
is located in the chunk directly to the east of <tt>chunk</tt>: that is how we achieve one matrix
test per <tt>ChunkData</tt> (on average).

<p>For each <tt>ChunkData</tt> we want 8 <tt>outflags</tt> values: one per corner, that we
need to compute and/or extract from nearby chunks. Once we have this information, we can check if a
<b>face</b> of the <tt>ChunkData</tt>'s bounding box crosses two planes: each face is composed of 4
segments and given 2 points that form a segment, this segment crosses two planes if the corresponding
<tt>outflags</tt> value of these points have at least <b>2 bits</b> that differ. Using the C language,
this can be trivially done using a XOR operation:

<pre><t>int</t>    pt1, pt2;      <span class="c">/* we'll see how to enumerate these in a bit */</span>
<t>int8_t</t> flagsPt1 = outflags[pt1];
<t>int8_t</t> flagsPt2 = outflags[pt2];

<span class="k">if</span> (popcount(flagsPt1 ^ flagsPt2) &gt;= <v>2</v>)
{
	<span class="c">/* segment crosses more than 2 planes */</span>
}</pre>

<p><tt>popcount()</tt> is the typical function name for counting the number of 1 bits in an integer,
it is a shorthand for <b>pop</b>ulation <b>count</b>. Since we are using 6 bit integers, we could
have used another lookup table, but most CPU nowadays have a dedicated instruction for this,
which are even <a href="https://github.com/BartMassey/popcount">faster</a> than a lookup table.

<p>If just one segment from the face crosses two or more planes, we consider the entire face as crossing
them too.

<p>In the implementation, two tests were added to <b>eliminate as early as possible some degenerate cases</b>.
Even though the code down the line is able to eliminate those, we might as well remove them as early as possible,
since those tests are very cheap.

<p>The first test check if all the <tt>outflags</tt> of a given face have their coordinates
outside the frustum, using a test like this:
<pre>sector1*sector2*sector3*sector4 != <v>0</v></pre>
<p>If one face has a coordinate inside the frustum (<tt>outflags == <v>0</v></tt>),
the nearby chunk will already be added by the first pass of the algorithm. Then the second test is:
<pre>sector1&amp;sector2&amp;sector3&amp;sector4 == <v>0</v></pre>
<p>This test ensure that not all the coordinates are on the same side of a plane. This happen
quite often at the starting chunk position: coordinates of a face are all to the left/right of a
plane, but also cross the top/bottom planes, therefore will be considered a cross-plane face and
an useless chunk will be added to the list. Not that much of a big deal, but since they are easy
to eliminate, might as well do it.


<h3 id="caveats"><span>Caveats</span></h3>

<p>These two passes will cover 99% of the use cases, even though there will still be cases where a
chunk will be included in the frustum, when it clearly does not belong. Consider the following example:

<div class="image">
  <img src="images/falsepositiv.png">
</div>

<p>The white square next to the starting chunk shouldn't be included in the visible list. What happened here,
is that the segment <tt>[0,2]</tt> crossed the left and right plane ... but outside the frustum. Because the
result of those inequalities we stored in the <tt>outflags</tt> table supposed that those planes extend to
infinity. Therefore point 0 will be considered <b>both</b> to be on left of the left plane <b>and</b> to the
right of the right plane.

<p>In practice, those false positives are quite rare, less than 1 in a thousand. It would be pointless to add extra
code to eliminate those. All the vertices from these chunks will be eliminated in the vertex shader, without
even reaching the fragment shader. As long as there aren't too many of these, performance loss will be negligible.

<h3 id="fakechunks"><span>Fake chunks</span></h3>

<p>But we are not done yet. A <prod>Minecraft</prod> map is composed of column of chunks. Those
columns are not all of equal height, far from it. Here's a XY slice view of a typical landscape:

<div class="image">
  <img src="images/sliceview.png">
</div>

<p>The yellow lines shows the sub-chunk boundaries, cyan chunks with no writings in it, indicate an
empty chunk: nothing is allocated for these, attempting to get a <tt>ChunkData</tt> for these will
return <tt class="o">NULL</tt>. Player is currently in one of those empty area, looking left, therefore
the algorithm will have no starting point, and as is, will generate an empty list of visible chunks.
Not good.

<p>If that's the case, a fake chunk will be created for the sole purpose of tracking where we are and
to check where we can go next. Those sub-chunks are actually cheap to allocate because we only need
a small subset of the fields contained in a <tt>ChunkData</tt> structure.

<p>But we need to avoid allocating useless fake chunks: a frustum with a 16 chunks render distance can
cross several thousands of sub-chunks if the frustum were completely full. When you are walking on the
surface, most of the frustum is composed of air, which would be wasteful to allocate a fake chunk
for something that isn't going to be rendered anyway.

<p>The heuristic used here is to only consider adding a fake chunk if <b>it crosses the bottom plane
of the frustum</b>. The reason for checking the bottom plane is because this is the only plane a column
of <tt>ChunkData</tt> is guaranteed to cross. Chunk columns are always contiguous: there are no gaps
between the bottomest and topmost <tt>ChunkData</tt>, if it wasn't the case, that heuristic wouldn't
work at all. Also, the pitch (vertical angle) of a player is always between [-pi/2, pi/2] (ie: you
cannot look upside down).

<p>The way it is checked is very similar to cross-plane faces: by checking the <tt>outflags[]</tt>
array, for a segment that has its 2 endpoints on the opposite side of the bottom plane.



<h3 id="outside"><span>Outside bounds</span></h3>

<p>Fake chunks work fairly well as long as we remain within build limit. Even if the engine would allow
unlimited build height, it would be pointless to allocate a gigantic column of fake chunks just to reach
the ground level, because we can do this by using some simple geometry. And besides, a geometric
approach is required when the player is below the bottomest chunk (i.e.: <tt>Y &lt; 0</tt>).

<p>Again, the problem here is that the frustum culling won't have a starting point, worse: <b>it cannot
have one</b>, because there is no place in the <tt>Chunk</tt> structure to store a reference, even for a
fake chunk.

<p>There are 2 cases to take care:
<ol>
  <li><b>Below built height</b>: right now we return an empty chunk list: you are not supposed to get here.
  And besides, even if you were to generate a chunk list, most voxel will be culled by the GPU because
  they are oriented backward.
  <li><b>Above build height</b>: we use the inverse MVP matrix to get the direction of the bottom plane
  of the frustum. With that direction, we check what's the nearest chunk it intersects (at highest possible
  location, whether there is a <tt>ChunkData</tt> or not). If there is a <tt>ChunkData</tt>, we use this
  as a starting point, otherwise we allocate a fake <tt>ChunkData</tt>.
</ol>

<h3 id="cavecull"><span>Cave culling</span></h3>

<p>There is one last step that is done at (almost) the same time: cave culling, or removing chunks that
are completely hidden by nearer chunks. A good primer on how this algorithm works can be read from the
original <a href="https://tomcc.github.io/2014/08/31/visibility-1.html">author</a> that developed it
for Minecraft MCPE.

<p>Cave visibility check is also <b>applied very early in the culling phase</b>, because it can prune
huge branches of chunks and thus avoid checking if a vertex is within the frustum, which, as a reminder,
requires a 4x4 matrix multiplication for each vertex.

<h4 id="cavecullv1"><span>First attempt</span></h4>

<p>In the linked blog post, it was mentioned that they first tried to remove chunks that are completely
surrounded by opaque chunks (ie: where the outer face is completely made up of opaque quad). Unsurprisingly,
the results were disappointing: it only culled about 1% of total chunks.

<p>A simpler approach were attempted for this engine, because computing the visibility graph is actuatlly
not that cheap (although with that information, <b>you can cull a lot of chunks</b>).

<p>The slight improvement was to realize that <b>a cube viewed using a perspective projection
matrix has at most 3 faces visible</b>. Instead of checking all 6 faces, we only need to check at most 3.
Checking if a face is fully opaque is very simple and super cheap to compute.

<p>Sadly, the results for this method were also disappointing: it culled about 10% of the chunks in the
view frustum. Caves leave too many holes in chunks, which means finding an entire solid face is quite
rare in practice.

<p>This section is just a reminder to not waste any time with any of these techniques.

<h4 id="cavecullv2"><span>Second attempt</span></h4>

<p>Second attempt was based on the algorithm described in the link above: compute visibility graph of
connected chunks, and traverse that graph while attempting to mimic a raycasting traversal of that graph.
The traversal was changed quite a bit though: the one used in <prod>Minecraft</prod> is a bit too aggressive,
and tend to discard chunks that are clearly visible (as of v1.17 the results are a lot better since it
was introduced in 1.8).

<h4 id="cnxgraph"><span>Computing visibility graph</span></h4>

<p>Computing the visibility graph is not that hard: in this engine it is implemented in
<tt>mapUpdate.c</tt>: <tt>mapUpdateGetCnxGraph()</tt>. It uses a 3D flood fill (as described in the blog
post), using a ring buffer (to simulate recursion) and bit-vector to manage which voxel has been visited.
This sounds way more complicated than it really is: there is about 40 lines of code for this function
(comments included).

<p>A simplification was done though: we only start the scan at the edge of the chunk: because we only
need to know which faces can be reached from a given face. Knowing there is a hidden hole in the middle
of a chunk, is an information we don't care at all. That means if the outer layer of the chunk is
completely solid, the flood fill should be rather cheap to compute (and kind of expensive if the chunk
is mostly air).

<p>The visibility of faces is <b>stored in a bitfield</b>. Since there are 6 faces, there are <b>15</b>
possible connections:

<table class="hspace" id="cnxgraphtbl">
  <thead><tr><td><small>to &#x25ba;<br>from &#x25bc;</small><td><tt>S</tt><td><tt>E</tt><td><tt>N</tt><td><tt>W</tt><td><tt>T</tt><td><tt>B</tt>
  <tbody><tr><th><tt>S</tt><td class="XXX"><td>1<td>2<td>3<td>4<td>5
         <tr><th><tt>E</tt><td>1<td class="XXX"><td>6<td>7<td>8<td>9
         <tr><th><tt>N</tt><td>2<td>6<td class="XXX"><td>10<td>11<td>12
         <tr><th><tt>W</tt><td>3<td>7<td>10<td class="XXX"><td>13<td>14
         <tr><th><tt>T</tt><td>4<td>8<td>11<td>13<td class="XXX"><td>15
         <tr><th><tt>B</tt><td>5<td>9<td>12<td>14<td>15<td class="XXX">
</table>

<p>This table shows the connection bit used to encode all the connections there are in a sub-chunk.
The connections are stored in <tt>ChunkData.cnxGraph</tt>: it is a bitfield (<tt>1 &lt;&lt; connectID-1</tt>)
that indicates which face has a visible path to another face. If there are no paths, that means the
face is blocking the visibility of a chunk.

<p>Knowing there is "hole" at the edge of a face (ie: the diagonal of the above matrix) is an information
we don't need, <b>except for the first visible chunk of the frustum</b>. If you start in such a chunk
and looking through that hole, there won't be any connection and therefore the cave culling will stop
right there, which is obviously not good. Those extra 6bits are actually stored in a separate field
(<tt>cdFlags</tt>).

<h4 id="cnxgraph"><span>Graph traversal</span></h4>

<p>This is the part that differs significantly from the blog post: it uses a more conservative approach,
which results in more chunks being drawn, but should not leave any unfilled hole in the world.

<p>The way it is done, is actually pretty simple: since frustum culling orders chunks from near to far,
we then scan the chunks from beginning to the end of that list. From a given chunk, we check if there
is <b>a path within the visibility graph</b> that can reach a previously visible chunk.

<p>We also use the fact that a cube in 3d space only have, at most, 3 visible faces. Going through
hidden faces will add a significant amount of hidden chunks. Visibility of a face is done by computing
the dot product between the face normal and the vector from camera to one point of the face.

<p>Therefore here is a simplified version of the graph traversal algorithm:
<div class="pre">
<ul>
  <li>For each visible <tt>ChunkData</tt> we got from frustum culling:
    <ul>
	  <li>For each face visible of this <tt>ChunkData</tt> (at most 3):
	    <ul>
		  <li>Get neighbor <tt>ChunkData</tt> directly connected to that face.
		  <li>From this neighbor <tt>ChunkData</tt> is there a path that allows us to go from the face
		  we entered this neighbor previously to the <b>opposite face</b> we are currently testing ?
		  <li><b>If yes</b>: save the face we entered current chunk and mark the chunk as visible.
		  <li><b>If no</b>: try with another face.
		  <li><span class="n">Note</span>: besides lack of connectivity, this test can also fail for
		  the following reasons:
		  <ul>
		    <li>The neighbor is outside frustum.
			<li>The neighbor was removed from the list by a previous iteration of this algorithm.
		  </ul>
		</ul>
	  <li>If there are no paths to any faces of the <tt>ChunkData</tt>, remove this chunk from the
	  visible list.
	</ul>
</ul>
</div>

<h4 id="startchunk"><span>Edge case: starting chunk<span></h4>

<p>Knowing this, you'll notice that the first chunk in the list is a bit special: there are no particular
faces where we entered this chunk. Since we don't know where we came from in this very first chunk, we
simply assume all directions are valid: this is what is encoded in the table <tt>canGoTo[]</tt>: For each
<tt>S, E, N, W, T, B</tt> face we want to check, assume assume we came from every direction, therefore
check connectivity for any direction.

<p>If a <tt>ChunkData</tt> is connected to this first chunk, we want to know if there is a path to that
face, from <b>any other direction</b>. Therefore we check all the connection ID that are possible
for a given face, as described in the <a href="#cnxgraphtbl">previous table</a>. So if we want to know
if we can reach the south face of the first chunk, we check if one of the connection ID is set for the
south face, that is either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Since connection graph is encoded as bitfield, the test becomes:
<pre><t>static int</t> canGoTo[] = {
	<v>0x001f</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>15</v>), <span class="c">/* to south:  1+2+4+8+16 */</span>
	<v>0x01e1</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>16</v>), <span class="c">/* to east:   1+32+64+128+256 */</span>
	<v>0x0e22</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>17</v>), <span class="c">/* to west:   2+32+512+1024+2048 */</span>
	<v>0x3244</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>18</v>), <span class="c">/* to north:  4+64+512+4096+8192 */</span>
	<v>0x5488</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>19</v>), <span class="c">/* to top:    8+128+1024+4096+16384 */</span>
	<v>0x6910</v>+(<v>1</v>&lt;&lt;<v>20</v>), <span class="c">/* to bottom: 16+256+2048+8192+16384 */</span>
};
<span class="c">/* neighbor is the first ChunkData */</span>
<span class="k">if</span> ((neighbor->cnxGraph | (neighbor->cdFlags &lt;&lt; <v>15</v>)) &amp; canGoTo[oppSide])
{
	<span class="c">/* yes, we can */</span>
	cur->comingFrom = side;
	<span class="k">break</span>;
}
</pre>

<p>The <tt>cdFlags</tt> test is needed in case the <tt>cnxFlags</tt> is empty (ie: no connections to
any faces at all), but the chunk has holes at the edge of a face.

<h4 id="uncertain"><span>Edge case: uncertain chunk<span></h4>

<p>When gathering all the chunks surrounding a given <tt>ChunkData</tt> (§2.3: <a href="#neighbors">Enumerating
neighbors</a>), graph traversal might depend on chunks outside of this 3x3x3 region. If that's the case
we mark the graph traversal as uncertain. When time comes to process this chunk marked as such, we will
check if this neighbor has been included in the frustum. If not, it will also be discarded. This case
is pretty rare though: less than 5% of <tt>ChunkData</tt>.


<p>This method is not as aggressive as the current version of <prod>Minecraft</prod>: it is far from
simulating a raycasting traversal, but can still easily cull 50% of chunks when above ground, and nearly
70% when underground. Still, way better than the first version.


<h3 id="altimpl"><span>Alternate implementation</span></h2>

<p>Understanding what's going on in a 3d space is usually quite difficult, since it usually involves
a lot of information: whether you try to do step by step debugging or display something in the 3d world,
the result is going to be tedious to analyze. An alternate implementation exists that limits the problem
in 2d space, which makes it <b>much easier</b> to understand and refactor in case of problems.

<p>Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/crystalcrag/MCEdit-utils">MCEdit-utils</a>:
the <tt>Frustum</tt> utility implement more or less everything that has been described in this chapter.
This utility is actually <b>the reference implementation when something has to be changed</b> in the
frustum culling algorithm, be it due to bug fix or trying to improve the function.
