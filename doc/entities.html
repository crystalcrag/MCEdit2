<h1 style="counter-set: h2 8">9. Entities</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>Entities refere to models that can move freely on the map, they are not constrainted to the voxel
grid. Their shape have much more liberty than what voxel models allow, and can be animated with more
freedom. On the other hand, this engine has been designed with the assumption that the number of
entities is significantly lower than voxels, usually around a couple of thousands.
</div>

<h2>Entities</h2>

<p>Entities in this engine refer to a model that is not aligned to the voxel grid: it can have arbitrary
position and/or rotation, and are not necessarily included in a <tt>ChunkData</tt> (which means that
frustum culling used by terrain <b>cannot</b> be applied to entities).

<p>This part will describe <b>how entities</b> (mobs, block moved by piston, dropped items, paintings, ...)
<b>are managed</b> within this engine. This part is not trivial just by looking at the source code, since
there are a lot of moving parts, with lots of datatypes:

<h3 id="structure"><span>Data structures</span></h3>

<p>There are a lot of datatypes used to manage entities, here a brief overview of the purpose of each one:

<ul>
  <li><tt>struct Entity_t</tt> : represents an entity from within the world, as such, they have
  a NBT record associated.

  <li><tt>struct EntityBuffer_t</tt> : <tt>struct Entity_t</tt> are allocated in batch (<tt>ENTITY_BATCH</tt>
  count, 256 by default). It is easier to handle entities if pointers are not reallocated, so that reference
  can be held within datatypes. Allocating them in batch, will somewhat keep those entities close in memory.

  <li><tt>struct EntityBank_t</tt> : hold model data that will be used to render entities: we'll use
  one model per entity, so that they can be drawed in a single call to <tt>glMultiDrawArraysIndirect()</tt>.

  <p>This API will need a command buffer (vboMDAI) and a per instance vertex data (vboLoc). This list will
  be rebuild with minimal changes whenever a entity is added or removed, which means a few more boilerplate
  tables to track usage (most notable one being <tt>mdaiUsage</tt>).

  <p>Assumption is made that entities around the player is rather low (less than 1000). As such, we
  don't care about frustum culling, we let the vertex shader do the work.

  <p>Once added, an entity model will remain in the VBO (there are no ways to remove models). Models will
  be reused as mush as possible: for example if a stone brick block is used in an item frame, is dropped
  as an item in the world or is pushed by a piston, all at the same time: there will be only one model
  allocated for all of these (but using different per instance information: rotation, scaling, lighting).

  <p>Models will also be rendered on demand: there are way too many to generate them all at startup.

  <p>Banks will hold a fixed number of vertices data: if that buffer is full or close to, a new bank
  will be allocated. The number of objects drawed can be unlimited though: if there are 1000 stone brick
  block dropped as an item around the player, it will use one model in the VBO and 1000 instance with
  different location/lighting.

  <li><tt>struct EntityModel_t</tt> : describe what's in all the VBOs: since VBO are only stream
  of bytes. We also need to know the vertex location, size, and bounding box.

  <li><tt>struct EntityEntry_t</tt> : given an entity, we want to know if its model is already available
  in one bank. Each models id (<tt>VBObank</tt>) are stored in a hash table that can give the model id
  (<tt>VBObank</tt>) given an item ID (<tt>ItemID_t</tt>).
</ul>

<p>The schema below shows how all these datatypes are interconnected. If you ever venture in <tt>entities.c</tt>,
keep that schema on hand, otherwise, you'll get lost:

<div class="photo">
  <img src="images/entities.png" style="width: 100%">
</div>

<p>It is not as complicated as it looks. First some legends:
<ul>
  <li>A <b>closed box</b> represent a fixed chunk of memory.
  <li>An <b>opened box</b> on the left side means that the block can be reallocated if more space is needed.
  That means there should be no pointers that holds a reference within those blocks, because its base
  address can change at any time.
  <li>An <b>arrow</b> means that within the datatype, there is a reference to the pointed datatype.
  Note that this reference is not necessarily a pointer (it is often just an integer, more on this below).
</ul>

<p>The "root" datatype is <tt>EntityPrivate_t</tt> (on the far left): this is a static global variable
that contains all the buffers/linked list for managing entities. Whenever an entity is found in the NBT
of a chunk, it is added to a list (in the first free slot). To avoid doing one allocation per entity,
they are allocated in batch of 256, those batches being stored in a linked list. An <tt>entityId</tt>
is <b>an integer</b> that can uniquely identify one entity: the first 8bits encode the index in the batch,
the remaining is the buffer number (ie: <tt>entityId&gt;&gt;8</tt><sup>th</sup> item in the linked list).


<p>But we don't want to allocate one model (vertex data for the GPU) per entity. In any given world, it
is extremely likely that only a couple of entity models will be used: a few hundreds usually, whereas
the number of entities can be in the thousands.


<p>That's the purpose of the <tt>EntityBank_t</tt> datatype: keep track of where a given model (vertex
data) is and the metadata necessary for each instance (one per entity). One entire bank can then be rendered
using a single OpenGL draw call, using <tt>glMultiDrawArraysIndirect()</tt>.

<p>Banks therefore have to manage 2 groups of arrays: model vertex data (<tt>vboModel</tt> and <tt>models</tt>)
and per instance information (<tt>vboLoc</tt> and <tt>vboMDAI</tt>):
<ul>
  <li><tt>vboModel</tt> is an OpenGL array buffer that can hold at most 64K <a href="#vtx10bytes">vertex</a>
  data (each vertex being 10 bytes). Once it is full, a new bank will be allocated. Also, once a model
  has been added, it cannot be removed.

  <p>To keep track of what's inside this <tt>VBO</tt>, we need a new array: <tt>struct EntityModel_t * models</tt>.
  This array will contain where the model is located in <tt>vboModel</tt> (vertex index and vertex count).
  And while we are here, the model structure will also contain to the model bounding box (derived from
  vertex data). This bounding box assumes that no rotations and no scaling are applied to the model.

  <li><tt>vboLoc</tt> is a per instance array buffer (<tt>glVertexAttribDivisor()</tt> set to 1). There
  is one instance slot per entity. All entities that use a model from the bank will be rendered in the
  same draw call, no matter how many entities references this model.

  <p>Therefore <tt>vboLoc</tt> and <tt>vboMDAI</tt> can be resized at some point.
</ul>

<p>The link between an <tt>Entity_t</tt> and and its model is stored in the <tt>VBObank</tt> field: it
encodes both the bank and the model id within an integer: the first 6bits encodes the bank number, the
remaining encodes the index in the <tt>models</tt> array.

<p>Bounding boxes are stored within the <tt>struct EntityModel_t</tt> datatype. In theory, they can be
extracted from <tt>BlockState_t</tt>, but it is way too much work. Bounding box for entities are always
assumed to be AABB, ie: no rotation taken into account when checking collision (but scaling will be).
Raypicking (ie: pointing an entity with mouse) will take rotation into account though.

<h3 id="collision"><span>Collision detection/correction</span></h3>

<p>Collision detection is implemented using a swept AABB algorithm and correction is done through sliding
adjustment and was strongly inspired by <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/swept-aabb-collision-detection-and-response-r3084/">this article</a>.

<p>This algorithm works extremely well in all use case, but it has one major limitation: it tends to
break down when bounding box are already intersecting.

<h3 id="partitioning"><span>Space partioning</span></h3>

<p>One aspect related to collision detection, is <b>entities enumeration</b>. Since entities are spread all
over the world and don't rely on the voxel grid, enumerating them without scanning the majority of
them, each time a collision detection need to be performed is somewhat challenging.

<p>Scanning the entire entity list is of course not a viable solution, since entities in a voxel engine
tend to move a lot (that's the main interest of entities: moving freely, unlike voxels). Therefore,
knowing which entities intersect an AABB, will be a very frequent query, and it better be optimized
to not fall into that dreaded O(N<sup>2</sup>) complexity.

<p>The solution used in this engine is to use a dynamic self-balancing quadtree. First, you might wonder
<b>why just a quadtree and not an octree</b>? The main reason for using a quadtree is that entities are
primarily spread on the XZ plane and very little on the Y axis: adding another dimension to the tree
would add very little performance gain, but lots of uneeded complexity and extra memory usage. An
octree would have made more sense it were used for other purposes, like frustum culling or raypicking.

<h4>Block map or quad tree?</h4>

<p>Another question worth answering is: <b>is it cheaper to use a block map instead of a quadtree?</b>

<p>One may be tempted to use the chunk itself as a crude block map for space partioning. In practice, it
is not that good of an idea, since a 16x16 area is quite big, even bigger if you consider that entities are
referenced through their center and therefore can overlap a nearby chunk depending on their size. In
practice, it means you'll have to scan more than one chunk each time you want to do a collision check
on a given entity.

<p>What if we use a finer block map grid? This can be interesting since an entity can be uniquely
identified using a 16bit integer (no need for a full pointer address).

<p>The resolution of the quadtree is "limited" to a 1x1 grid at the finest level (which is quite small
actually). Using a block map of this size is too expensive though: 512 bytes per chunk, which in pratice
would have to be allocated for almost every chunk, since entities are almost everywhere in a typical
<prod>Minecraft</prod> map.

<p>Therefore, there are only 2 choices left: a 2x2 or 4x4 grid (8x8 and 16x16 being too coarse). Which
adds respectively 128 and 32bytes per chunk. On a far render distance (32x32 grid of chunk loaded),
as far as memory usage goes, that would be 128K and 32K of memory needed, which is still far more than
a quadtree need (around 10K), and the quadtree will give you way more precision than a 4x4 grid.

<p>Conclusion: a quadtree is more efficient as far as memory is concerned, but will require a bit more
CPU usage. Just a reminder to not waste any time implementing this.

<h4>Auto-resize quad tree</h4>

<p>The problem with using a quadtree in a voxel world is that its size must <b>accomodate the player
movements</b>. If the player moves a lot in the XZ plane, at some point the quadtree will hold reference
to objects that are completely outside render distance, which is a waste of memory usage and CPU to
reach the leaf nodes of the tree.

<p>The way it is handled in this implementation, is by <b>auto-resizing the quad tree</b>: when adding
an item in the tree, if its initial position is outside of the current bounding box of the quadtree,
as many top layers as necessary will be added, until the object position is included in the bounding
box.

<p>When an object is deleted, this implementation will try extra hard to prune empty branches and/or
relocate leaf node to higher level layers. These operations are not that expensive, otherwise as the
player moves, top layers will kept being added to cover the increasing distance between the spawn area
and the current position. At some point, the tree will have so many layers, that it will be necessary
to perform as many bounding box checks as a 16x16 block map (which is what the quadtree was supposed
to avoid).





<h2 id="emitters">Particle emitters</h2>

<p>Here is the way particle emitters are handled in this engine:

<ol>
  <li>While a chunk is turned into a mesh of quads (<tt>chunkUpdate()</tt> in <tt>chunks.c</tt>),
  each voxel is checked for a type of particle they can emit. If the conditions are met, a list of
  potential emitters is stored at the <tt>ChunkData</tt> level. The emitters are not immediately
  made active, only those close to player position will. This list store emitters as 4 16bit
  integers. They are not accessed through a <tt>struct</tt>, because it involves bitfield and the
  struct is not necessarily aligned (also this "struct" is used in only 3 different functions in the
  entire engine).

  <li><b>Emitters cover an area</b>. A first implementation allocated one emitter per block. In practice,
  this was not a very good idea, because some blocks are very common and can allocate lots of emitters,
  like lava or powered redstone dust. Instead, an emitter cover an XZY area of 16x16x2 (ie: 2 vertical
  layers of a chunk). That means for a particular type of particle emitted, at most 8 emitters will
  be created (for a given chunk).

  <li>When a particle has to be created, the emitter will search through its area where the block
  is or are located. Since the area covers 512 voxels, a 32bit bitfield is used to narrow the search:
  each bit indicate in which Z row to look for a block. That means at most 16 blocks have to scanned
  per row, which is pretty cheap, because it is a contiguous memory buffer.

  <li>The emitter also holds how many blocks there are in the area that can spawn particles. Therefore
  the search will continue until all emitters are found.

  <li>Emitters are grouped by type and interval: since all blocks are scanned at the same time, if
  timing interval is different it has to be done in a different emitter.

</ol>

<p>This schema shows how the information is stored at the <tt>ChunkData</tt> level (in <tt>emitters</tt>
field):
<bits>
  <brow><hdr>0: </hdr><bitpart class="sz8" bit="16">8: <em>count</em></bitpart><bitpart class="sz5" bit="8">5: <em>type</em></bitpart><bitpart class="sz3" bit="3">3: <em>Y</em></bitpart><bitpart class="sz0" bit="0"><em>&nbsp;</em></bitpart></brow>

  <brow><hdr>1: </hdr><bitpart class="sz16" bit="16">16: <em>interval</em> (ms)</bitpart><bitpart class="sz0" bit="0"><em>&nbsp;</em></bitpart></brow>

  <brow><hdr>2: </hdr><bitpart class="sz16" bit="16">16: <em>area LO</em></bitpart><bitpart class="sz0" bit="0"><em>&nbsp;</em></bitpart></brow>

  <brow><hdr>3: </hdr><bitpart class="sz16" bit="16">16: <em>area HI</em></bitpart><bitpart class="sz0" bit="0"><em>&nbsp;</em></bitpart></brow>
</bits>

<p><b>Note</b>: <tt>count</tt> is only 8bits instead of 9. In practice having more than 256 block
emitters in a 16x16x2 region is extremely rare (lava lakes can easily reach that number though, but
not more than 256). Also note that numbering in this field starts at 0. 0 means there is 1 block that
can emit particles.

<p>Once player location is known, emitters from all 27 <tt>ChunkData</tt> surrounding the player are
made active. As the player moves, this list will be adjusted by removing the emitters that are too far
away, and making active the one that got within 1 chunk distance away from the player. The emitters
that are still within range must not be changed, otherwise their timing will be reset.
