<h1 style="counter-set: h2 7">8. Raycasting</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>This engine implements two different but complementary techniques. The previous <a href="#mesh.html">chapter</a>
focussed on the first one: rasterization. This chapter is about the second one: raycasting.

<h2 id="raycasting">Raycasting</h2>

<p>Raycasting is a technique that cast rays in straight lines from the camera position to some distant
world coordinates and see what kind of voxel it intersects. In some ways, it ressembles raytracing
or path tracing, except there are no reflections, refraction or scattering effect taken into account.

<p>The reason for having a completely different rendering path is that rasterization of meshes works
very well close to the camera, but starts to have some diminishing return on distant geometry: at some
point the amount of triangles needed, becomes way too large to be pratical. This is where raycasting
is interesting: at long distance, you can pretty much consider all voxel types to be full and only
perform intersection check as if everything is made of <tt>SOLID</tt> voxels, which is much cheaper
than doing precise bounding box check at close range.
