<h1 style="counter-set: h2 3">4. Block API</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>This engine uses a somewhat generic way to describe all the blocks
and their associated models for each state. There are some provision to also describe their behaviour,
but some large chunk remains hardcoded for now. Most notably: redstone updates (defining the behavior
of all redstone devices in a generic way is no easy task).

<p>Still, the API described here permits quite a few liberty on what the engine can do, and if paired
with the TileFinder tool, those changes can be done fairly easily.
</div>


<h2 id="blocks">Block API</h2>

<p>This section will describe how the block description table works (<tt>blocksTable.js</tt>). This
table describes all of the blocks recognized by this engine and their different states, along with
their custom models if any.

<p>This table does not cover 100% of use cases though: you cannot change it and expect to have a
completely different "game". Some special processing is hardcoded within the engine (like redstone
behavior, block with tile entities). Still, this table is used to define a huge chunk of the engine
behavior.

<p>This table uses the javascript object notation format. It is similar to the JSON format, with a few
changes: property names don't have to be enclosed in double quotes and property values can contain expressions.

<p>For the sake of simplifying the parsing, property names have to start with a <b>lower case letters</b>,
constants assigned to property must be spelled using only <b>uppercase letters</b>.

<p>This table contain <b>2 types of objects</b>:
<ol>
  <li><b>Block description</b>: contain generic information about the block, like its type, id,
  name, inventory category, inventory model, ... That information must remain true for all states.
  If that's not the case, some properties can also be declared at the state level.
  <li><b>State description</b>: also known as meta-data. Each block in the terrain can have up to 4bits
  of extra information, that can describe 16 different states. This is the purpose of these objects:
  provide a complete description of one state: custom mesh model and/or texture coordinate if block
  is completely solid. Not all 16 states have to be defined, but at least 1.
</ol>





<h3 id="blockdesc"><span>Block description</span></h3>

<p>A block description must contain the property <tt>id</tt> and be assigned to an integer. Here are the
possible properties:
<ul>
  <li><tt>id</tt>: the block ID as it is stored in the NBT table <tt>Sections/Blocks</tt> of a chunk.
  <li><tt>type</tt>: how the block will be rendered in the world. This field will constraint what is
  expected for state description. <b>This is a very important field</b>, you can choose one value among:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>INVIS</tt>: invisible. No mesh will be generated for these (typical use case: AIR).
    <li><tt>SOLID</tt>: a full 1x1x1 voxel cube. This engine is optimized to display these. They are
	cheap to process, cheap to render and cheap to define: just specify the texture of the 6 sides of
	the cube and that pretty much all there is to it.
	<p>Note: stairs and slab are considered SOLID blocks.

    <li><tt>TRANS</tt>: Similar to SOLID, they must be defined as a full unit cube. The difference is
	in the way hidden surface removal works: for SOLID blocks, all sides shared by any other solid block
	will be removed. For TRANS block, this check will only be done with the same block id (typical use
	case: glass or water).
    <li><tt>QUAD</tt>: for blocks that are a mix of flat quads that does not necessarily forms a cube.
	Typical use case: crops, grass or flowers.
    <li><tt>CUST</tt>: completely arbitrary shape, a custom model will be expected for each state
	description. Keep in mind that the model cannot exceed a 1x1x1 cube in size, because of frustum
	culling. If you need more, you will have to use an entity instead.
  </ul>
  <li><tt>name</tt>: a human readable name that will be displayed in various places of the engine.
  <li><tt>tech</tt>: the technical name stored in inventories. If the name is the same as the <tt>name</tt>
  field (but converted to lowercase and space replaced with underscore), you can omit that field.
  <li><tt>inv</tt>: how this block is going to be represented in inventory menus. It is an enumeration
  value that can be assigned to one of the following values:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>CUBE</tt>: each individual states will have its own inventory item in the form of a cube. The
	textures used for the cubes will be described in the state description. In the screenshot below, cube
	inventory items have been highlighted with a green background.
    <li><tt>ITEM2D</tt>: each states will be represented as flat 2d texture (taken from state description).
	In the screenshot below, they have a gray background.
    <li><tt>MODEL</tt>: will use a custom model for their inventory. The model will be viewed at an angle
	using a orthographic projection (not a perspective one). You can provide a custom model to be used
	only in inventories, or you can reuse the ones defined in the state description. In the screenshot
	below, those items have been highlighted with a red background.
  </ul>
  <div class="image">
    <img src="images/inventory.png">
  </div>
  <li><tt>invstate</tt>: sometimes, you don't want to have one inventory item per state, but only one
  (typical use case: blocks that have an orientation). If this field is present, it must contain the
  state id (between 0 and 15) to use when displaying this item in inventories.
  <li><tt>cat</tt>: the creative menu is split into tabs. This field let you choose which one it will
  be in. If not specified, the item will appear in the "all" category (the tab with the compass, in the
  screenshot above). You can choose one value among;
  <ul>
    <li><tt>BUILD</tt>
	<li><tt>DECO</tt>
	<li><tt>REDSTONE</tt>
	<li><tt>CROPS</tt>
	<li><tt>RAILS</tt>
	<li><tt>FILLBY</tt>: blocks that should not be in survival/creative inventory, but can be used
	as to fill space using extended command (fill and geometric brush).
  </ul>
  <li><tt>special</tt>: special behavior to activate in the engine. Possible choices:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>CHEST</tt>: chest that can form a 2-wide entity. Therefore, that does not include ender chest.
    <li><tt>DOOR</tt>: behave like a door: 2 tall block with the same data values.
    <li><tt>NOSIDE</tt>: will generate a front and back face (typical use is for QUAD block type).
    <li><tt>HALF</tt>: half block: data values will encode placement.
    <li><tt>STAIRS</tt>: data value will encode orientation.
    <li><tt>GLASS</tt>: behave like a glass pane: automatically connect to nearby block with this
	special attribute set (like glass pane and iron bars).
    <li><tt>FENCE</tt>: wooden fences that connect with similar block.
    <li><tt>FENCE2</tt>: nether fence (does not connect with FENCE).
    <li><tt>WALL</tt>: cobblestone wall and variants: it connects with more block than FENCE or GLASS.
    <li><tt>RSWIRE</tt>: used for redstone wire only: wire model depends on nearby blocks.
    <li><tt>LEAVES</tt>: hidden surface must not be removed.
    <li><tt>LIQUID</tt>: water and lava.
    <li><tt>TALLFLOWER</tt>: need a special flag for these, because they are made of 2 blocks.
    <li><tt>RAILS</tt>: this flag is used when placing rails to know which neighbor to update.
    <li><tt>TRAPDOOR</tt>: block update from redstone/user.
    <li><tt>SIGN</tt>: they need special processing (allocate off-screen texture).
    <li><tt>PLATE</tt>: pressure plate (needed for redstone signal).
    <li><tt>SOLIDOUTER</tt>: only useful for <tt>CUST</tt> block type: the block model will be a mix
	of <tt>SOLID</tt> and <tt>CUBE</tt>: the outer layer of the model will use a unit textured cube,
	using the texture declared in the <tt>tex</tt> field of the state description. The purpose of
	this flag is to allow custom block model to benefit from ambient occlusion.
    <li><tt>BED</tt>: their models depend on tile entity.
  </ul>
  <p>Additionally, you can OR these values, with the following flags (ie: separated by |):
  <ul>
	<li><tt>CNXTEX</tt>: generate connected texture for all state description. Texture will be auto-generated
	from state description.
	<li><tt>NOCONNECT</tt>: don't generate connected info. Typical use case: fence gates. They connect
	with fences, and therefore have the FENCE flag, but don't have optional parts like fences.
  </ul>
  <li><tt>bbox</tt>: how the block can be targeted with the mouse. Enumeration value, with the following
  choices:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>NONE</tt>: this block cannot be targeted by user.
    <li><tt>AUTO</tt>: this mode will be automatically set for block type <tt>SOLID</tt>, <tt>TRANS</tt>
	and <tt>QUAD</tt>. Therefore, you can omit the <tt>bbox</tt> field for these types.
    <li><tt>MAX</tt>: this type is intended for <tt>CUST</tt> block type: <tt>MAX</tt> will compute
	the maximum axis-aligned box that covers the entire model.
    <li><tt>FULL</tt>: another mode for <tt>CUST</tt> block type: each individual part of a custom model
	will be used to check if the block is targeted. This type of collision test is very precise, but
	of course a bit more expensive to check.
  </ul>

  <li><tt>bboxPlayer</tt>: bounding box used for player/entity collision detection. The only supported
  value for this field is <tt>NONE</tt>. Otherwise, it will use the same value than the one specified in
  the <tt>bbox</tt> entry.

  <li><tt>orient</tt>: if block placement is orientation dependent, you can specify with this field
  how individual state description can be automatically chosen based on player orientation and/or block
  targeted:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>LOG</tt>: 3 possible orientation: E/W, N/S, or up right.
    <li><tt>FULL</tt>: 6 possible orientation: south, east, north, west, top, bottom.
    <li><tt>BED</tt>: 4 possible orientation, composed of 2 blocks.
    <li><tt>SLAB</tt>: 2 orientation: lower half, upper half.
    <li><tt>TORCH</tt>: 5 orientation: stick to wall or up right.
    <li><tt>STAIRS</tt>: 8 orientation.
    <li><tt>SENW</tt>: 4 orientation (typical: chest, furnace).
    <li><tt>SWNE</tt>: 4 orientation but different state description (typical: repeaters, comparators).
    <li><tt>DOOR</tt>: 8 orientation.
    <li><tt>SE</tt>: 2 orientation: E/W or N/S, typical use case: rails.
    <li><tt>LEVER</tt>: 8 possible orientation: used by lever and buttons.
  </ul>

  <li><tt>emitLight</tt>: if this block will emit block light, you can indicate a value between 1 and 15
  (0 being the default).

  <li><tt>opacSky</tt>: how much intensity of sky light it will absorb. Default is 15 for <tt>SOLID</tt>
  and 0 for everything else. Usual values are 1 for leaves and 3 for water.

  <li><tt>opacLight</tt>: same with block light. Note: block light decreases by 1 for every step away
  from a light source. Therefore if you want a more "absorbing" block, the minimum value should be 2.

  <li><tt>tile</tt>: will add a default tile entity when placed in the world. Needed by Minecraft, not
  necessary for this engine.

  <li><tt>invmodel</tt>: state id (between 0 and 15) where to copy model to be rendered in inventories.
  This particular block will have only one item in the creative menu (instead of one per state).

  <li><tt>rswire</tt>: indicates how redstone wire connects to this block. Possible values are:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>ALLDIR</tt>: all possible direction (S, E, N, W).
    <li><tt>FRONTBACK</tt>: can connect to the front and back of the block (repeaters).
    <li><tt>BACKONLY</tt>: only from back (observer).
  </ul>

  <li><tt>rsupdate</tt>: indicates if this block cares about redstone update. Enumeration that can
  have one of the following values:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>RECEIVE</tt>: block state will change when redstone signal change nearby.
    <li><tt>GENERATE</tt>: will generate the redstone signal.
    <li><tt>INOUT</tt>: will do both: update states with redstone signal and output a signal (ie: repeaters, comparators).
  </ul>  

  <li><tt>placement</tt>: constraint the block has to satisfy to be placed in the world. If those
  constraint were to be invalidated due to nearby update, the block will be automatically deleted.
  The field should be a string, described a list of constraints separated by commas. Each constraint
  can use the following keyword:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>ground</tt>: any type of solid flat ground.
    <li><tt>wall</tt>: any type of solid flat wall.
	<li><tt>solid</tt>: any solid face from a block.
	<li><em>techName</em>: that particular block.
  </ul>
  <p>Note: the block is considered correctly placed if one of the constraint is satisfied. "Solid"
  means a block that has been declared with the type <tt>SOLID</tt>. That excludes <tt>CUST</tt> and
  <tt>TRANS</tt>.

  <li><tt>particle</tt>: type of particles this block will emit constantly.

  <li><tt>invmodel</tt>: custom model to use when this block is displayed in inventories. Should only
  be necessary for block type <tt>CUST</tt>, even though nothing prevent you from using with any other
  type. The format of this field is a bit complicated and be explained in the <a href="#blockmodel">next section</a>.

  <li><tt>pushable</tt>: how this block is going to be affected if pushed/retracted by a piston. Enumeration
  value that can take one of the following value:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>NO</tt>: block can't be pushed, nor retracted (obsidian, chests, ...)
    <li><tt>YES</tt>: default value for all blocks except <tt>QUAD</tt>.
    <li><tt>PUSHONLY</tt>: can only be pushed, but not retracted (glazed terracotta).
    <li><tt>DESTROY</tt>: completely destroy the block if pushed (leaves, grass, ...): this is the
	default for <tt>QUAD</tt>.
    <li><tt>DROPITEM</tt>: remove the block, but create an item entity (flowers, ...).
  </ul>
  <p><b>Note</b>: this engine supports moving blocks containing tile entities (furnace, chests, ...),
  even though in the default block definition file (<tt>blocksTable.js</tt>), they have been marked
  as non-movable.

  <li><tt>gravity</tt>: integer that can be either <tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt>. If set to <tt>1</tt>, the
  block will be converted to a falling entity, if placed above air (be it manually or with pistons).

  <li><tt>keepModel</tt>: hack.
</ul>

<h3 id="statedesc"><span>State description</span></h3>

<p>An object declaration is recognized as a state declaration if it is contains a <tt>state</tt> property
with an integer assigned to it. Beside this property, you can also use these ones:
<ul>
  <li><tt>state</tt>: an integer between 0 and 15 that will be stored in <tt>Sections/Data</tt> table in a chunk.
  This table has only 4bits of information per block. More information can be stored using TileEntity.
  <li><tt>name</tt>: this field should describe a bit more in detail what the state is doing: for example,
  if the block is orientation dependent, you should include which way the state is pointing, or if the
  block has an opened/closed state, this is where it should be described...

  <p>Since this field will almost certainly have <b>a lot of redundant information</b>, there are a few
  facility to prevent you from repeating the same text over and over again: the less redundancy, the
  easier it will be to fix mistakes.

  <p>First, a state name can include an underscore (<tt>_</tt>) in the text. This character will
  act as a reference point for later names. The character itself will be replaced by a regular space.

  <p>Once you have a reference point, you can ask to include everything that was before using the <tt>+</tt>
  or <tt>-</tt> character, and then continue your text.

  <p>The text being appended will always be added with a parenthesis before (and a closing one if none
  are specified in the text), unless there was already an opening one in the text that was copied.

  <p>Here are a few examples:
  <table class="listview">
  <thead><tr><td class="nowrap">Block name<td>State name<td>Expanded into<td>Description
  <tbody>
    <tr><td rowspan="4"><tt>Log</tt><td><tt>+oak</tt><td><tt>Log (oak)</tt><td>Without any previous underscore, the whole text of block will be added.
    <tr><td><tt>+spruce</tt><td><tt>Log (spruce)</tt><td>Still no underscore specified, the reference point will remain the same on next line.
    <tr><td><tt class="nowrap">Bark (_oak)</tt><td><tt>Bark (oak)</tt><td>If the text does not include <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt>, then it replaces everything. A new reference point is also set.
	<tr><td><tt>-spruce</tt><td><tt class="nowrap">Bark (spruce)</tt><td>The new reference point now point to a state description, instead of the block.
  </table>

  <li><tt>tex</tt>: texture coordinates to use to draw the faces of that block. Coordinates are actually
  tile coordinates: integers between 0 and 31 that will point to a texture tile in the file <a href="../resources/terrain.png">terrain.png</a>.
  That way the coordinates will work no matter what resolution the file is, the default tile set is 16x16px,
  but you can use whatever size you want (tiles needs to be square though). Although allowed, it is
  strongly discouraged to use a size that is not a power of 2, due to mipmapping (texture will "bleed"
  at the edge of tiles). You can omit that field, in which case it will use the same texture coordinates
  than the previous state (as declared in the file).

  <p>This field is expecting an array of integers. The number of coordinates will depend on the type of the block:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>SOLID</tt>, <tt>TRANS</tt>: 12 integers that form 6 pairs of U, V tile coordinates, one
	pair for each faces, specified in the order <tt>S,E,N,W,T,B</tt>. The coordinate must be specified
	relative to the top left corner of the tile you want to use for that face.
	<li><tt>QUAD</tt>: 2 integers: the tile texture to use for all quads (integer between 0 and 31).
	<li><tt>CUST</tt>: 8 integers: technically not required to render the block, since block model will
	provide their own texture coordinates, but this field will still be used for particles when this
	block is destroyed by the user. You don't have to specify the texture for the top and bottom face
	though, although it doesn't hurt to include them.
  </ul>

  <p>Filling those values manually is possible, albeit tedious and error prone. In the default <tt>blockTable.js</tt>
  field, all the values where filled with the help of <tt>TileFinder</tt> (check out the repository
  <a href="https://github.com/crystalcrag/MCEdit-utils">MCEdit-utils</a>).
  
  <p>This field can include a 13th integer, that will be used to specify the <tt>rotate</tt>
  field (because <tt>TileFinder</tt> can read and write those 13 values at once).

  <li><tt>quad</tt>: an array of symbols indicating which quad to render for this block. Each symbol
  can be one of the following enumeration value:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>CROSS</tt>: used for flower, grass, ...
	<li><tt>SQUARE</tt>: usually crops.
    <li><tt>NORTH</tt>: attached to north of block (ladder, vines).
    <li><tt>SOUTH</tt>: attached to south face.
    <li><tt>EAST</tt>: east face.
    <li><tt>WEST</tt>: west face.
    <li><tt>BOTTOM</tt>: bottom of block (lily pad).
    <li><tt>ASCE</tt>: ascending from west to east (rails).
    <li><tt>ASCW</tt>: ascending from east to west.
    <li><tt>ASCN</tt>: ascending from south to north.
    <li><tt>ASCS</tt>: ascending from north to south.
  </ul>

  <li><tt>inv</tt>: this field can be used to override what has been specified at the block level.
  Remember, that the type of inventory item specified in the block will be applied to all state description.
  The typical use case is to prevent some states from appearing in the inventory (ie: <tt>NONE</tt>).

  <li><tt>model</tt>: an array of floating point numbers. This field is absolutely not intended to be
  edited manually. The format will be described <a href="#blockmodel">below</a>, but even with this
  description, you'll have a hard time filling this field manually.
  <p>Instead, an external tool is almost required: <tt>TileFinder</tt>. You'll notice that all models
  are declared on their own lines (there no JSON tokens mix in those lines, besides what's required
  to make an array of numbers). The reason for this, is that those lines can be selected in a standard
  text editor, then copied and pasted inside <tt>TileFinder</tt> to see what the model looks like.
  You can also copy the model from <tt>TileFinder</tt> to the text file again, if you modify it later.

  <li><tt>rotate</tt>: rotate applied to texture coordinate, 6 groups of 2 bits. Rotation are ordered
  <tt>S,E,N,W,T,B</tt>. The texture will be rotated in multiple of 90&deg; clock-wise (when viewed
  in front), the multiple being the number encoded as 2bits.

  <li><tt>emit</tt>: where emitters are located in the model. An array containing one emitter location
  per entry. It can be one of the letter <tt>S,E,N,W,T,B</tt>, indicating that the entire face can emit
  particles (the location will be randomly selected when a particle is spawned). Or it can be a number:
  if the block has a custom model, this is the primitive number that will be used as location.
</ul>

<h3 id="blockmodel"><span>Block models</span></h3>

<p>Custom models that don't fit <tt>QUAD</tt> or <tt>SOLID</tt> can still use arbitrary shapes using
the property <tt>model</tt> on a state description object. All the models has been filled using
an external application: <a href="https://github.com/crystalcrag/MCEdit-utils"><tt>TileFinder</tt></a>.
This section will describe how the models are encoded, even though it can be edited by hand, anything
more complex than a slight value change will certainly require the use of a 3d modeler.

<p>Contrary to typical models description format (like <tt>.obj</tt>) which usually only contains
triangles, this format uses cubes/boxes as basic primitives, where each face can be selectively
hidden or textured. You can also apply rotation, scaling, translation to each individual box and
by grouping multiple boxes, you get a model.

<p>Each lines usually represent a primitive (ie: box), with tags describing what the following numbers
means. A line ends where the next one starts (or when there are no more numbers to process). The starting
tag will always be <tt>FACES</tt>. All the other tags can be specified in any order. Here are all the
tags recognized, and their expected arguments:

<table class="listview">
<thead><tr><td>TAGS<td>argument<td>Description</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td><tt>FACES</tt><td>1 integer<td>This tag describe the start of a new primitive. If a previous
  <tt>FACES</tt> tag was found, the previous primitive will stop processing arguments and generate
  triangles out of all the parameters given. The agument to this tag is one integer encoding a bitfield
  of the sides of a cube that will have texture information. The bitfeld uses the order <tt>S, E, N, W, T, B</tt>
  order, which are respectively assigned to the number 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. Therefore 63 is a full box.
  <tr><td><tt>DETAIL</tt><td>none<td><tt>TEX</tt> parameter will describe the exact coordinates to apply
  to each face of the primitive.
  <tr><td><tt>CUBEMAP</tt><td>none<td><tt>TEX</tt> will be a single tile from the main texture atlas, 
  but will be reduced to the size/location of the primitive, within that tile. Typical use case is to
  applied wood texture on fences for example, without having to precisely select the coordinates
  for each faces.
  <tr><td><tt>INHERIT</tt><td>none<td>Similar to <tt>CUBEMAP</tt>, but reuse texture coordinates specified
  for the last line that had <tt>CUBEMAP</tt>. This keyword cannot be set on the first line, there must
  be a previous <tt>CUBEMAP</tt>, otherwise it is considered a bug.
  <tr><td><tt>SIZE</tt><td>3 floats<td>Size of the box, specifying the X, Y, and Z axis. 16 represent
  the size of a voxel (because original texture tile were 16x16px). You can specify fractional number.
  <tr><td><tt>ROT90</tt><td> 1 integer<td>Rotate the model by 90 degrees steps on the Y axis. Similar
  to <tt>ROT</tt> or <tt>ROTCAS</tt>. Unit is in degrees and must be multiple of 90 (ie: should only
  use the numbers 0, 90, 180 or 270). Normals will be recomputed. This tag is only recognized on the
  <b>first line</b>, will be ignored on subsequent lines and <b>cannot</b> be cancelled.
  <tr><td><tt>ROT</tt><td>3 floats<td>Arbitrary rotation on X, Y and/or Z axis. The rotation will only
  be applied to the current model. Unit is in degree.
  <tr><td><tt>ROTCAS</tt><td>3 floats<td>Similar to <tt>ROT</tt>, but the resulting matrix will be
  applied to subsequent models too. <tt>ROTCAS</tt> can be reset to identity with the <tt>INC_FACEID</tt>
  keyword.
  <tr><td><tt>TR</tt><td>3 floats<td>Apply a translation to the primitive. Same unit as <tt>SIZE</tt>.
  <tr><td><tt>REF<tt><td>3 floats<td>Center of rotation for <tt>ROT</tt> or <tt>ROTCAS</tt>. Without
  this tag, the center of rotation will be the center of the primitive. Same unit as <tt>SIZE</tt>.
  <tr><td><tt>NAME</tt><td>string<td>Only used by TileFinder: giving a name to model parts, makes it
  easier to locate when there are a lot of them.
  <tr><td><tt>DUALSIDE</tt><td>none<td>All faces defined for this primitive must not be culled by
  the back-face culling test.
  <tr><td><tt>INC_FACEID</tt><td>none<td>Used by connected models. This tag can also be used to reset
  the <tt>ROTCAS</tt> matrix to identity: useful if you want to group boxes and move them as one unit.
  <tr><td><tt>TEX</tt><td>n floats<td>A variable number of floats depending on which tag was provided
  earlier. It depends on <tt>FACES</tt> and texture apply mode (<tt>DETAIL</tt>, <tt>CUBEMAP</tt> or
  <tt>INHERIT</tt>):
  <ul>
    <li><tt>CUBEMAP</tt>: 24 numbers, grouped as 6 x 4 numbers: describe the texture to apply on each face
	(S, E, N, W, T, B order), with 4 numbers per face (see below for format).
	<li><tt>INHERIT</tt>: nothing. Should use the numbers provided by the last <tt>CUBEMAP</tt> line.
	<li><tt>DETAIL</tt>: 4 numbers per active face (ie: <tt>popcount(FACES) * 4</tt>).
  </ul>
  <p>Each number must encode a <tt>UV</tt> coordinate (ie: two numbers). <tt>U</tt> can vary from 0 to 512,
  and <tt>V</tt> from 0 to 1024. <tt>U</tt> can therefore address 513 numbers, thus the formula for each
  number is <tt>U + V * 513</tt>. To get back the coordinates for these numbers, you can use:
  <pre>div_t UV = div(tileUV, <v>513</v>); <c>/* UV.quot = U, UV.rem = V */</v></pre>

<p>Remember, that you can copy a group of lines to the clipboard and paste them into <tt>TileFinder</tt>
to see what a model will look like. You can then modify the model in here, and once you are satisfied
with the changes, copy the model back to clipboard to paste it back in the file.
