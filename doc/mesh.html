<h1 style="counter-set: h2 6">7. Mesh generation</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>Mesh generation is the part that converts level data into a bunch of triangles suitable for the
GPU. This being the very central part of a voxel engine, you can bet there is a lot work that needs
to be done. Most of this is done in the source file <tt>chunkMesh.c</tt>.
</div>


<h2>Mesh generation</h2>

<p>Welcome to <b>look-up table hell</b>.

<p>This engine supports 3 major types of voxel elements that can be converted into meshes. Each <b>have
their pros and cons</b>:

<ol>
  <li><tt>SOLID</tt>: these are the <b>bread and butter of a voxel engine</b>: a block that occupies the full
  space of a voxel. It can have arbitrary textures on all 6 sides, hidden faces can be culled easily and
  efficiently, and have a precise lighting model (including skylight, blocklight and ambient occlusion).

  <p>The <b>native "resolution"</b> of this engine is actually "half" a voxel: i.e.: a full voxel that
  has been split in half on the X, Y and Z axis. Which means a full voxel is made of 8 sub-voxels
  (i.e: you can, for example, render all kind of slabs with this: vertical, horizontal, 2x1, ...).

  <p>This type of voxel will also have <b>greedy meshing</b> applied on them: if the corner parameters
  of a quad matches nearby voxels, quads will be merged to keep vertices count under reasonable limits
  for the GPU.

  <p>A typical map is usually composed of 80% of these blocks, therefore they require quite a bit of
  work (thus, will need <b>a lot</b> of look-up tables).

  <li><tt>CUST</tt>: voxels that can have an <b>arbirary shape</b> and have a much greater precision than half-blocks.
  The major drawback with these is that their <b>lighting model is greatly simplified</b>: for example, they
  don't generate any ambient occlusion. Also the same skylight and blocklight is applied to the entire
  model: if you were to generate a floor out of these with a block light nearby, you would be able to
  see that the transition between light values is not smooth at all (and have that <prod>Minecraft</prod>
  alpha feels).

  <p>Hidden face culling is still performed aggressively on these: a full voxel model will therefore
  be culled the same way as a <tt>SOLID</tt> block.

  <p>This type includes blocks like fences, glass panes, pistons, torches, chests, doors, ...
  
  <p>Note: this type of blocks also includes what is known as "chiseled" blocks: slab and detailed blocks
  (X, Y, Z split by 8).

  <li><tt>QUAD</tt>: this is a <b>very simple voxel to process</b>: only a handful of combination exists
  and all of them are trivial to process compared to the previous two. The typical use case for these
  are flowers, crops, grass, rails...

  <p>Like <tt>CUST</tt>, they use a simplified lighting model: single skylight/blocklight value for
  the entire model, and no ambient occlusion. Technically, they could be handled as <tt>CUST</tt>, but
  specifying a custom model each time they are needed is way too tedious.
</ol>

<p>Note: keep in mind that all blocks must be aligned inside the voxel grid. Technically, it is possible
to generate triangles at arbirary position, but the voxel manipulation functions won't be able to handle
it. To place a model at a truly arbitrary position, you need to use entities: this will be covered in the
next section (and have their own pros and cons).

<h3 id="meshsolid"><span>SOLID voxel</span></h3>

<p>These blocks requires quite a bit of work to be converted into meshes. First, keep
<a href="#quadface">this picture</a> in mind, its information will be used <b>extensively</b>
in the entire meshing phase.

<h4 id="vtxtex"><span>Vertex and texture coordinates</span></h4>

<p>Converting a full solid voxel into a pseudo quad (technically a <tt>GL_POINT</tt>, that will be transformed
into 2 triangles in the geometry shader to a form a <tt>GL_QUAD</tt>), you need just a couple of look-up tables:

<pre style="font-size: 0.8em"><t>uint8_t</t> vertex[<v>3</v>*<v>8</v>] = { <span class="c">/* 8 vertices of a 1x1x1 cube */</span>
    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,  <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,  <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,  <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,
    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,  <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,  <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,  <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,
};
<t>uint8_t</t> cubeIndices[<v>6</v>*<v>4</v>] = { <span class="c">/* face (quad) of cube: S, E, N, W, T, B */</span>
    <v>9</v>, <v>0</v>, <v>3</v>, <v>6</v>,    <v>6</v>, <v>3</v>, <v>15</v>, <v>18</v>,     <v>18</v>, <v>15</v>, <v>12</v>, <v>21</v>,     <v>21</v>, <v>12</v>, <v>0</v>, <v>9</v>,    <v>21</v>, <v>9</v>, <v>6</v>, <v>18</v>,      <v>0</v>, <v>12</v>, <v>15</v>, <v>3</v>
<span class="c">/*  3, 0, 1, 2,    2, 1,  5,  6,      6,  5,  4,  7,      7,  4, 0, 3,     7, 3, 2,  6,      0,  4,  5, 1 */</span>
};
<t>uint8_t</t> texCoord[] = { <span class="c">/* tex coord for each face: each line is a rotation, indexed by (Block.rotate&amp;3)*8 */</span>
    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,
    <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,
    <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,
    <v>1</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>0</v>,    <v>0</v>,<v>1</v>,    <v>1</v>,<v>1</v>,
};
</pre>

<p>It is as simple as it gets: <tt>vertex</tt> refers to the coordinates in world space (if the cube were
to be rendered at 0,0,0) of each corner, then to get the 4 coordinates of a given face <tt>cubeIndices</tt>
are indices within <tt>vertex[]</tt> array. The indices are pre-multiplied by 3, to avoid doing it in
the <b>many places</b> this array is used. The order/orientation is described in <a href="#quadface">this
picture</a>.

<p>In case you are wondering, the vertices and face order have no particular meaning nor does them
enable special tricks. All of this was chosen kind of arbitrarily very early in the development and
turned out to be OK: neither particularly good, nor bad.

<p>Keep in mind that coordinates for the mesh will be relative to the sub-chunk origin (a 16x16x16
chunk of terrain). In the vertex shader, each sub-chunk will receive a <tt>vec3</tt> offset that
will be added to every vertices.

<p><b>The order in which vertices of a face are enumerated</b> has a meaning though: it is done so that
all the remaining information (texture coordinates, lighting, ambient occlusion) can be applied the
same way on all faces.

<p>The <tt>texCoord</tt> array encodes 4 different rotations of a texture:

<div class="image">
  <img src="images/tex-rotate.png">
</div>

<p>Since there are 6 faces and you need 2 bits to encode each rotation, the <tt>BlockState_t.rotate</tt>
field contains 12bits of information. You cannot mirror a texture though, for this you'll need to a <tt>CUST</tt> voxel.

<h4 id="skyblock"><span>Block and sky light</span></h4>

<p>Each of the 24 vertices of a cube can have an independant block and sky light value, so that values
can be smoothly interpolated across a face. Each vertex will depend on 4 sky/block light: the 4 voxels
that share the vertex in the direction of the face normal. This is the purpose of the <tt>skyBlockOffset[]</tt>
table (it contains too many numbers to be displayed here).

<p>Each number in this table refers to a voxel, that is using the same coordinate system than the one
used in the <a jref="#cube3x3">frustum culling</a>:

<p><img src="images/quad_face.png" style="width: 66%; float: right">

<table class="skewed">
<tr><td>18<td>19<td>20
<tr><td>21<td>22<td>23
<tr><td>24<td>25<td>26
</table>

<table class="skewed">
<tr><td>9<td>10<td>11
<tr><td>12<td><v>13</v><td>14
<tr><td>15<td>16<td>17
</table>

<table class="skewed">
<tr><td>0<td>1<td>2
<tr><td>3<td>4<td>5
<tr><td>6<td>7<td>8
</table>

<p>Whenever a <tt>SOLID</tt> block has at least one face visible, we extract the 26 surrounding voxels:
block ID and data value (in the array <tt>blockIds3x3[]</tt>) as well as block light and sky light
(in the array <tt>skyBlock[]</tt>). Each of these two arrays have 27 elements, ordered like in the table
above.

<p><tt>skyBlockOffset[]</tt> then encodes the 4 values we need per vertex: 4 vertex per face, that means
16 values per face, 96 items in total. For block light, we take the maximum among the 4 values, for
skylight we take the minimum if the value is not 0.

<p>For example, the south face has the values <tt class="o">15</tt>, <tt class="o">16</tt>, <tt class="o">24</tt>,
<tt class="o">25</tt> for the first vertex. If you look at the face order schema, the first vertex of
the south face is vertex 3 (arrow inside the square shows the order). There are 8 voxels that share
this vertex, but we only take the 4 that are in the direction of the face's normal (otherwise there
are too many).

<h4 id="cnxtex"><span>Connected textures</span></h4>

<p>Connected texture only applies to full block. More complex models like glass pane uses a different
approach (and will be described in the <tt>CUST</tt> section).

<p>For full blocks, the base model of its texture will be used to generate all the variations. Since
there are 4 sides, it means there are 16 possible combinations. As of writing this, this is done by removing
a one pixel line from a given side. These are generated in <tt>blocks.c:blockPostProcessTexture()</tt>.
This is for example, what it looks like for the glass texture:

<div class="photo">
  <img src="images/cnxtex.png" style="background-color: black; border: 5px solid black; width: 512px">
</div>

<p>To know which texture to use, you just need to set a bitfield if the block on top (bit1), right (bit2),
bottom (bit3) or left (bit4) "connects" with the current voxel. By default, U texture coordinate is
set to 0, therefore, you just have to shift it by <tt>bitfield * 16</tt> to simulate a connection.

<p>Left, right, top and bottom are relative to a face, therefore a new look-up table is needed:
<tt>offsetConnected[]</tt>. It encodes the 4 blocks to look for connection in the <tt>blockIds3x3[]</tt>
table (24 elements in total). Each group of 4 elements is of course ordered top, right, bottom and left.

<h4 id="meshhalf"><span>Half-block</span></h4>

<p>Half-block is actually the native "resolution" of this engine. Seems simple enough and you might wonder
what the big deal with these ? Well, you'll have a glimpse as to why Mojang has not added vertical slab to
<prod>Minecraft</prod> yet (as of writingthis, in august 2021): they introduce <b>a lot</b> of edge cases,
and sadly, it means <b>lots of look-up tables</b>.

<p>The first thing to keep in mind with half-block is, that <prod>MinecrafT</prod> treat them as if they were
a <tt>SOLID</tt> voxel: they completely block sky light and block light no matter what their orientation
is. If you attempt to get block or sky light at their coordinate, you'll get 0.

<p>/* ... */

<h4 id="ocs"><span>Ambient occlusion</span></h4>

<p>/* ... */

<h3 id="meshcust"><span>CUST voxel</span></h3>

<p>Custom voxels are blocks that cannot be represented as a <tt>SOLID</tt> voxel. They can have an
arbitrary shape, but their lighting is quite simplified compared to <tt>SOLID</tt>. For example they
usually do not generate ambient occlusion, unless one of their face line up with the voxel grid.

<p>Mesh data is stored in memory and read from the main block description table (<tt>blocksTable.js</tt>).
These models use the <a href="#vtx10bytes">10 bytes per voxel</a> vertex data. In the meshing phase
they are converted to 28 bytes per quad. This conversion is pretty straightforward, albeit a bit messy
to look at with all these bit twiddling hacks.

<p>There is one aspect that is not that trivial to handle though: <b>connected models</b>.

<h4 id="cnxmodels"><span>Connected models</span></h4>

<p>Some models <b>can have optional parts</b> that can be removed based on nearby voxels. The overtypical
example being fences:
<div class="image">
  <img src="images/cnxmodels.png">
</div>

<p>Yet, if you look at the model definition for every type of fence, you'll see <b>only one model</b>
being defined for each. The way it is handled is this engine is by tagging each vertex by an integer.
In the model <a href="#vtx10bytes">vertex data</a>, this ID is stored in the sky/block light information,
using 5 bits out of the 8 available (lighting information make no sense at this point, that's why it is
perfectly safe to repurpose those fields). That means each models can have up to <b>32 different connected
parts</b>. As of writing this, the models that have the most parts are glass panes with 18 parts.

<p>In case of fences, they only have 4 different parts: the 4 extensions around the center piece. In the
meshing phase we check for blocks around the custom model if those optional parts can connect to. This
is done in the function <tt>blockGetConnect()</tt>: the return value will be a bitfield of the parts
that should be included in the chunk's mesh.

<p>Then, in the chunk mesh generation, the unused parts are filtered using this simple test:
<pre><span class="k">if</span> (faceId &gt; <v>0</v> &amp;&amp; (connect &amp; (<v>1</v> &lt;&lt; (faceId-<v>1</v>))) == <v>0</v>)
{
	<span class="k">continue</span>;
}
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>connect</tt> is the bitfield encoding the parts that should be included in the mesh. Since
it is a 32bits integer, that's where the limit of 32 optional parts comes from. An ID of 0 for a face
means that the face will always be included (like the central piece of a fence).


<p>/* ... */

<h3 id="greedymesh"><span>Greedy meshing</span></h3>

<p>Greedy meshing refers to a technique used to <b>merge quads</b>, in order to reduce the amount of vertex
data the GPU will have to process. In a typical voxel engine, GPU performance is more or less proportionnal
to the number of vertices, so the lower the quad count, the better the performance.

<p>In the initial phase for all voxel type (<tt>SOLID</tt>, <tt>CUST</tt> or <tt>QUAD</tt>), <b>no merging
is attempted</b>. The mesh of a chunk is generated entirely with quads that fit within a voxel.

<p>Then a second phase will try to merge them. Implementing this in 2 phases, make the implementation
<b>quite simple</b>: you only need a hash table of the quad you can potentially merge (some quads cannot:
they need to be axis-aligned and cover the full side of a voxel). The other advantage of having 2 passes
is that merging can be easily disabled, just to be sure it is not the cause of some weird graphical glitch.

<p>Then in the merging phase, you scan the entirety of that table. For each quad, you try to expand
in the 2 directions perpendicular to their normal and expand them as much as possible. Merged quads
will be marked as deleted, and will be removed right before sending them to the GPU. The process is
really as simple as that.

<p>Expansion needs to take into account quite a few parameters though: texture coordinates, ambient
occlusion, skylight and blocklight values. Which means the merging is not as good as you might
think. Still, better than doing nothing. With a typical minecraft map, this technique can reduce the
number of quads by 20% to 30%.

<p>Caves are particularly bad when it comes to merging: too many weird shapes, which generates different
occlusion values for almost every quads. This is where cave culling helps a lot more.

<p>In the <b>fragment shader</b>, you need to a bit more work though: you cannot rely on <tt>GL_REPEAT</tt>,
since the textures of all the blocks are stored in an atlas (which is set to <tt>GL_CLAMP</tt> anyway). Merged
quads will have their texture coordinates expanded to let OpenGL perform the perspective interpolation.
The fragment shader will also be provided with the texture origin. Then the only thing left to do is
to mod the texture coord provided to the fragment shader by 1/512 in U and 1/1024 in V and add this
to the texture origin (which is, by the way, the reason why only full quads are merged).
