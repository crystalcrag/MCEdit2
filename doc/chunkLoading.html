<h1 style="counter-set: h2 2">3. Chunk loading</h1>

<div id="abstract"><u>Abstract:</u>
<p>Voxel terrain are usually pretty big and as such cannot be loaded all at once. Even loading a partial
area requires careful consideration to avoid lag spikes all over the place, especially when the player
is moving around the map. This chapter will describe the techniques used in this engine: be particularly
careful when venturing in the multi-threaded section, this part is not obvious to understand by just
reading the source code.

<p>The source code for this part is located in the file <tt>meshBanks.c</tt>.

<p><b>Pre-requisite</b>: C programming language and multi-threading primitives (Mutex, Semaphore).
</div>

<h2 id="loading">Chunk loading</h2>

<p>This engine supports 2 strategies for loading chunks: <b>single-thread and multi-thread</b>. Single thread
is pretty straightforward, multi-thread is a bit more challenging to follow. This section will contain
some high-level view on how both works.

<h3 id="single"><span>Single thread chunk loading</span></h3>

<p>To understand multi-threaded chunk loading, you first have to understand how single-thread works.
It is actually pretty straightforward. Chunks are stored into a 2 dimentionnal array. The size of this
array is <tt>render_distance*2+4</tt>, where <tt>render_distance</tt> can go from 1 to 16. I.e: on 16
chunks render distance, the array is 36x36 chunks (1296 chunks). Here's how they are split:
<ul>
  <li>The chunk <b>where the player is</b>, forms a map with a render distance of 0.
  <li>For each increment of the render distance, we add a square ring around this center chunk.
  With a render distance of 16, that would be a 33x33 grid of chunks. These are the chunks that will
  be scanned by the frustum culling, they are known as "<b>visible</b>" chunks.
  <li>But we will need more than this: to generate the mesh of a chunk, we need the 8 surrounding
  chunks to be also loaded. That means, we need an extra ring around the farthest visible ring of
  chunks. These chunks are known as "<b>lazy chunks</b>": only the bare minimum of these chunks are loaded:
  block data. With a 16 render distance, we would need a 35x35 area now.
  <li>A single column and a single row of chunks is added for <b>leaway</b>. Making the grid 36x36 on
  a 16 chunks render distance. The reason for this leaway is when the player moves back and forth between
  the boundary of 2 chunks: without that leaway, huge amount of data would have to be deleted/recreated
  each time the boundary is crossed.
</ul>

<p>For example, this is how chunks are split with a render distance of 1:
<div class="photo">
  <img src="images/chunkGrid.png">
</div>

<p><tt>2</tt> is where the player is. We add one ring of chunks around, because the render distance
is only 1, making the visible grid 3x3. Then another ring for lazy chunks in order to generate the
mesh of the visible chunks. Finally, one row and one column of chunks for leaway.

<p>The grid is obviously a <b>2 dimentionnal ring buffer</b>. For example, this is what will happen
to the grid, when the player has moved 4 chunks in the south/east direction (the center chunk is now
at position 0,0 on the grid, i.e: number 44):

<div class="photo">
  <img src="images/chunkGridMoved.png">
</div>

<p>In single threaded mode, whenever the map center is moved (or upon initial loading), all chunks
will be scanned to see if a mesh needs to be generated for them. The chunks that are not loaded, will
be stored in a linked list (<tt>genList</tt> field of <tt>struct Map_t</tt>), <b>sorted by their
distance</b> from the center.

<p><b>Frustum culling</b> can reorder that list a little bit. This is to give higher priority to the
chunk that are immediately visible: if frustum culling grab a chunk that have no mesh yet and is
scheduled to be processed, it is simply moved in front of the list.

<p>Then, in the <b>main rendering loop</b>, we check if this list contain some chunks waiting to be
processed. If yes, we run the loading/meshing function, until some time has passed (around 15ms).
After that we give the control back to the rendering loop. This is obviously to avoid slowing the
framerate too much.

<p>And that's pretty much all there is to it. It works rather well, but you can clearly feel the
framerate dropping upon initially loading, and still feel some lag on render distance above 10 or so
(if you move diagonnally, you will have to load <tt>4*render_distance+3</tt> chunks, each time the
player move onto another chunk).

<p>Sadly, to avoid that lag, there is no other way but to have a <b>multi-threaded chunk loading system</b>.


<h3 id="#meshing"><span>Meshing pipeline</span></h3>

<p>Vertices for the GPU are generated in <tt>chunkMesh.c</tt>, in the function <tt>chunkUpdate()</tt>.
This function will simply scan the block IDs of a <tt>ChunkData</tt> and look for any visible faces,
and generate a quad suitable for the terrain shaders. This is a very quick overview on how meshing
works, the details are not important at this point, but it will be described more in detail in
the <a href="mesh.html">dedicated chapter</a>. For the purpose of this chapter, just imagine a buffer
containing fixed size quads (in this case 32bytes) to be drawed by the GPU.

<p>Quads are split into 3 categories:
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>SOLID</tt> quads</b>: quads that do not have any translucent part and as such can be <b>draw
  in any order</b> (assuming depth test is enabled).

  <li><b><tt>SOLID</tt> discard</b>: this is an <b>optimization technique</b> for quads that use a binary
  transparency (typical use case: leaf blocks). These quads will be <b>discarded from GPU</b> draw commands,
  if they are far enough away. What happen in this case is that mipmaps will turn a binary transparent
  texture in a fully opaque one, therefore hidden face removal can be applied .... if the quad is far
  enough away.

  <li><b><tt>ALPHA</tt> quads</b>: these quads need a separate draw command and need to <b>sorted from
  back to front</b>. Depth buffer is no use for these, they have to be rendered no matter what, therefore
  <b>there are no <tt>ALPHA</tt> discard</b> category: translucency will be kept down to the lowest
  mipmap level.
</ul>

<p>Vertex data written by <tt>chunkUpdate()</tt> is always written on the CPU first. The reason being,
that once this function has finished, there are a few more steps to apply on these buffers before the
GPU can use them.

<p>All these quads will be written one after the other in vertex buffers, the first job to do once the
meshing function returns in to group these quads back into these 3 categories. You might wonder why
is this not done directly in meshing phase: indeed, it is not that difficult to group them right when
they are generated, but there is another step that will dramatically shuffle these quads all over the
memory: greedy meshing. This step will leave lots of "hole" in the buffers (quads that have been merged),
and as such, you'll to scan the buffer entirely and shuffle memory blocks all around anyway.

<p>Each quads type (<tt>SOLID</tt>, <tt>SOLID</tt> discard and <tt>ALPHA</tt>) has a flag in the vertex
buffer, so that you can easily identify them later. Once you know how many there are for each category,
you can transfer them to the GPU in a single, continuous buffer. For a given <tt>ChunkData</tt>, quads
will be arranged this way:
<ul>
  <li>First, all the normal <tt>SOLID</tt> quads. If the <tt>ChunkData</tt> is visible, these quads
  will always be rendered no matter what.

  <li>Immediately following are the discardable <tt>SOLID</tt> quads. To discard these quads if they
  are too far away, it is a simple matter of changing the primitive count when <b>drawing normal
  <tt>SOLID</tt></b>, since the vertex data is right after.

  <li>At last there are the <tt>ALPHA</tt> quads. These ones have to be drawed in a separate draw
  command, sorted (at the quad level) from front to back.
</ul>



<h3 id="#multi"><span>Multi thread chunk loading</span></h3>

<p>Multi-thread and OpenGL usually don't mix well. This engine uses a paranoid approach to multi-thread
chunk loading: threads that handle chunk loading/meshing <b>must not change anything to the OpenGL context</b>.
All OpenGL interactions must be done by the main thread, <b>no exceptions whatsoever</b>.

<p>Easier said than done though, especially since the C programming language is not really helping in
this area. To its defense, this is not a trivial subject.

<p>On a <b>high level view</b>, this is how the system works:
<ul>
  <li>A <b>pool of threads</b> is created when a map is loaded. This pool is rather small: default
  compilation will set this to 1. More than 2 is overkill, the speedup will be barely noticeable.

  <li>Each threads will <b>wait for chunks to be processed</b> (using a semaphore). This is the exact same
  list that is built in single thread context, but is now guarded by a semaphore to keep track of
  how many chunks needs to be processed. The number in the semaphore must contain the exact number
  of item in the list.

  <li>When a thread grab a chunk to be processed, it starts <b>loading the 8 surrounding chunks</b>.
  Overlaps with other threads is extremely likely to occur at this point. Arbitration needs to be in
  place to avoid loading a chunk twice (which will cause lots of memory leaks).

  <li>Once all is loaded. The mesh of the chunk is generated in a <b>staging memory buffer</b> (not owned by
  the GPU).

  <li>Since threads are completely independant from the main thread, the <b>staging buffer is fixed in size</b>.
  If the main thread is stuck doing something else (ie: not monitoring the chunks ready to be uploaded to the
  GPU), they could potentially generate tens of megabytes of mesh data waiting to be uploaded. Which
  is mostly useless. That's why the staging buffer is limited to 2Mb. This value was callibrated for
  2 threads. More threads would probably require a bigger buffer.

  <li>Chunks that are completed, are stored in a dedicated list, that is scanned from the main rendering
  loop. The only thing left to do at this point, is to copy data from the staging area to a VBO of
  the GPU (ie: it is just a bunch of <tt>memcpy()</tt> call). Which is <b>very</b> cheap: 99.9% of
  the processing time is spent loading (disk read), unpacking (zlib inflate), and meshing the content
  of each chunks.
</ul>

<p>Sadly, all of this steps require very <b>careful synchronization</b> in order to not shoot into your
feet.

<h4 id="#staging"><span>Staging memory management</span></h4>

<p>This is the most critical part to understand multi-threaded meshing. The staging memory is where
the mesh of a chunk is written (on the CPU side). Once here, it is almost ready to be uploaded to the GPU.

<p>When a thread starts meshing a chunk, the thread doesn't know how big the mesh is going to be. The
staging memory being fixed in size, it cannot reserve the entire memory just for a single chunk. Therefore
the memory has to be allocated in small blocks (255 32byte quads with default compilation, which is 8160
bytes or slightly under 8Kb). These blocks contain information that only the GPU can use, therefore, a
header has to be added in order for the main thread to tell which part goes where. This header is 8bytes in size.

<p>The staging memory is composed of 256 of these blocks, which means it is exactly 2,091,008 bytes (slightly
under 2Mb).

<p>The 8 bytes header, is accessed as 2 unformatted uint32_t (i.e: there are no dedicated struct for this):

<ul>
  <li><tt>[0]</tt>: chunk position in <tt>map->chunks</tt>: lower 16bits are <tt>Chunk</tt> reference,
  upper 16 bits are for <tt>ChunkData</tt> layer. Ie:
  <pre>Chunk chunk = map->chunks + (mem[<v>0</v>] &amp; <v>0xffff</v>);
ChunkData cd = chunk->layer + mem[<v>0</v>] &gt;&gt; <v>16</v>;
  </pre>
  <li><tt>[1]</tt>: Amount of data stored in the chunk, divided in 3 fields:
	<ul>
	  <li>Lowest <b>16bits</b>: next slot of staging memory that is part of this chunk. Since blocks
	  from staging memory are fixed in size and mesh data are not, you might need several staging
	  block. This field will be the next block in the chain. If <tt>0</tt>, this block is the last.
	  <li>Middle <b>8bits</b>: number of vertices stored in the block. Each vertices is 32bytes (well,
	  as of writing this). Each block can hold at most 255 vertices.
	  <li>Last <b>8bits</b>: number of discardable vertices.
	</ul>
</ul>
